# Set14 Dataset Repository

This repository contains the Set14 dataset, which has been compressed using Guetzli for optimized storage. The Set14 dataset is commonly used for image super-resolution tasks.

## Description

The Set14 dataset consists of 14 images that are widely used as benchmarks for evaluating image super-resolution algorithms. The images in this dataset have been carefully selected to cover a diverse range of scenes and textures.

## Set14HQ Version

Additionally, this repository includes Set14HQ, consisting of the same images but upscaled 4x using [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN). This high-quality version provides enhanced resolution versions of the original Set14 images while maintaining visual fidelity through advanced super-resolution techniques.

## Compressed with Guetzli

The files in this repository have been compressed using Guetzli, a JPEG encoder that optimizes for high visual quality at small file sizes. This ensures that the images retain their visual fidelity while reducing their storage requirements.
